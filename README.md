# POGL project

## Introduction

This project aims to create a realistic ocean rendering using a method called the Fast Fourier Transformation.

I'm a student and this is my project for an OpenGL course at EPITA teached by J. Fabrizio for the IMAGE 2023 promotion.

NEVER COPY PASTE A PROJECT YOU FOUND ON THE INTERNET. Even tho you're a student, you SHOULD NEVER copy paste this project for your own grading. You MAY use this to see a rendering example.

Our team is composed of two maintainers (students):
- `melanie.tcheou`
- `paul.galand`
